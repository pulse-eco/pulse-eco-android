/**
 * Provides a path coverage algorithm for {@link Graph} instances.
 * Finds all {@link Graph} nodes that a {@link GraphAgent} can reach by any movement path that
 * starts on a specified node, and whose total cost does not exceed a specified maximum cost.
 * <p>
 * The total path cost is defined as the sum of all {@link GraphAgent#getStepCost} results
 * for each movement step between two adjacent path nodes. Only nodes for which {@link
 * GraphAgent#canOccupy} succeeds are considered reachable.</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Caution:</b> Multi-step movements are problematic when the {@link GraphAgent} uses a
 * non-trivial {@link GraphAgent#canOccupy} condition. After a successful path search, all
 * found {@link #nodes} are valid end points for a single-step movement. However, attempting
 * to reach any {@link #nodes} element with multiple movement steps may prove impossible.
 * Since the algorithm does not know whether a given intermediate path node will be occupied
 * permanently or merely traversed, the path by which a {@link #nodes} element was reached may
 * contain many intermediate nodes for which {@link GraphAgent#canOccupy} fails.</p>
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of all nodes in the {@link Graph}
