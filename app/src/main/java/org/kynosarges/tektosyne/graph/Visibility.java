/**
 * Provides a line-of-sight algorithm for {@link Graph} instances.
 * Starts on a specified starting node and recursively finds any adjacent nodes,
 * up to a specified maximum world distance, whose line of sight is not blocked by
 * any other examined nodes closer to the source. The opacity of any given node is
 * determined by a user-supplied {@link Predicate}.
 * <p>
 * For each tested node, we consider its polygonal world region as defined by {@link
 * Graph#getWorldRegion}. We draw the two tangents from the source node’s world location
 * to the extreme points of that region. An opaque node blocks visibility, across the angle
 * between its tangents, for any node whose nearest world region vertex is farther from the
 * source than that of the opaque node. A node is considered visible as long as a certain
 * fraction of its tangential arc remains unobscured, as defined by {@link #threshold}.</p>
 * <p>
 * If an opaque node obscures only the middle part of another node’s tangential arc, but
 * leaves partial arcs on both ends visible, only the greater of these partial arcs is
 * considered visible whereas the smaller is considered obscured. This simplifies visibility
 * testing, although very rarely visible nodes may be misclassified as obscured if the size
 * of world regions varies greatly among {@link Graph} nodes.</p>
 * <p>
 * Any graph node for which {@link Graph#getWorldRegion} returns {@code null} is assigned
 * a default tangential arc, spanning one degree around its world location. This allows the
 * {@link Visibility} algorithm to process graphs that do not define world regions for all
 * nodes, although the results are likely not very useful.</p>
 * 
 * @param <T> the type of all nodes in the {@link Graph}
