# Working with project secrets

## Official pulse.eco secrets

In order to protect API key configuration used in this project from abuse by malicious third party, they are protected by encryption using `git-secret`, read more on [git-secret](https://git-secret.io/).

1. Install [git-secret](https://git-secret.io/installation). If you are using Windows, [try using Windows Sybsystem for Linux](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret/issues/40).

```
brew install git-secret
```

2. Follow instructions on [git-secret.io](https://git-secret.io) on how to create RSA key-pair for GPG
3. Once exported, store your key-pair somewhere safe (Example: password manager, cloud storage)
4. Share your public key (`public-key.gpg`) with some of the maintainers on pulse.eco Slack.
   - Mainteiner: follow instructions how to perform `git-secret tell`.
5. After maintainer has confirmed that you have been told the secret, `git pull` latest changes (make sure on correct branch).
6. To decrypt/reveal the secrete in the project.

```
git-secret reveal
```

7. If everyting worked correctly, you should have all the things needed to build the project.

## Using your own secrets

If if don't want to know the official secrets or you are not eligible to know them, you can still setup the project with you own secrets.

Files that need to be generated by you:
```
buildSrc/src/main/java/ProjectSecrets.kt
app/google-services.json
```

Instructions what they need to contain, coming soon. If eager to try out, ping on our Slack, you will be guided.
